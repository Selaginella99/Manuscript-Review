In general, the authors reported the negative correlation between mtDNA damage and aging in dentin from two Spanish populations. It is a possible approach to estimate the age-at-death based on mtDNA from teeth in the forensic cases. However, the study was poorly presented in tables and figures and it is lack of correct statistical analysis in methods. 

## To authors

It seems the first study to provide estimation of age-at-death by evaluating mutations in mtDNA from teeth in sixty Spanish. 

However, the study was poorly presented in figures with uncertain statistical analysis and also lack of description tables.

- Oxidative damage may affect mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription with aging, and results in alterations of the mtDNA including point mutations, deletions and DNA strand breaks. As authors had developed a new methodology to analyze mtDNA, it will be better to compare the other detection of mitochondrial DNA mutations as control in both populations.

- In the statistical analysis, it is necessary to describe what tests were used to compare difference between the two populations, and analyze the correlation and regression. 

- Main characteristics of the study subjects should be presented, like sample size, sex and folds of HV2 amplification of all the ages in Figure 1.

- In all the tests, a *p*-value below 0.05 was considerated to be significant. But either the negative correlation between the number of defective amplification events and age in dentin or pulp were shown corresponding *p*-value in both populations in Figure 1. 

- The same problem in Figure 2, only correlation coefficients were presented, but their associated *p*-value were not given respectively, the significance was not statistically evaluated.
