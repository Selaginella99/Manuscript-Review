## To editors

In general, the authors reported the negative correlation between mtDNA damage and aging in dentin from two Spanish populations. It appears to be a new approach to estimating the age-at-death based on mtDNA from teeth in the forensic cases. However, the study was very convincing for its claims because of apparent flaws in statistical analysis, therefore major improvement is needed in statistical analysis section (see my extended comments in response to authors). Additional tables are also need to be added. Also, text and titles on figures need grammar check. 

In sum, the paper could not be published in its present form, major revision is recommended. 


## To authors

It seems the first study to provide estimation of age-at-death by evaluating mutations in mitochondrial DNA from teeth in sixty Spanish. 

However, major improvement of statistical analysis is needed, and additional description tables are also needed to be performed. 

- P5. Line5: 

Analysis of mtDNA damage is based on real-time PCR. However, â€œthe analysis of relative gene expression data was calculated using..." is not very precise. HV2 in D-loop is not a coding gene and it could use "folds of amplification" instead.

- Oxidative damage may affect mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription with aging, and results in alterations of the mtDNA including point mutations, deletions and DNA strand breaks. As authors had developed a new methodology to analyze mtDNA, it will be better to compare the other detection of mitochondrial DNA mutations as control in both populations.

- In the statistical analysis, it is necessary to describe what tests were used to compare difference between the two populations, and also the tests to analyze the correlation and regression. 

- Main characteristics of the study subjects should be presented, like sample size, sex and folds of HV2 amplification of in all ages in Figure 1.

- In all the tests, a *p*-value below 0.05 was considered to be significant. But the negative correlation between the number of defective amplification events and age in dentin and pulp was shown the corresponding *p*-value in both populations in Figure 1. 

- The same problem in Figure 2, only correlation coefficients were presented, but their associated *p*-value were not given respectively, the significance was not statistically evaluated.
 
- The image quality of figures should be improved with consistent and proper front size.
