## To editors

The authors suggested a new approach to estimating the age-at-death based on mtDNA from teeth, which could potentially benefit areas of forensic evaluation and aging research. They reported the strong linear negative correlation between mtDNA amplification and age in dentin from two Spanish populations. 
However, the study was not very convincing for its claims because of lack of detail on statistical analysis, and lack of discussion on advantage of the proposed method over existing TCA approach. Major improvement are, therefore, needed in statistical analysis and discussion sections (see my extended comments in response to authors). Also, text and titles on figures need grammar check. 

In sum, the paper could not be published in its present form, ... is recommended. 


## To authors: 

It seems to be the first study to provide estimation of age-at-death by evaluating mutations in mitochondrial DNA from teeth in sixty Spanish. The suggested approach may potentially have significant impact on both aging research and forensic cases, in case if it substantially improves accuracy of other methods of estimating age-at-death using dental material, such as TCA (tooth-cementum annulations).

However, major improvement of statistical analysis is needed, and some clarifying tables have to be included, as described below. Also, discussion on advantage of the proposed method over existing TCA (tooth-cementum annulations) approach, especially in terms of the method’s accuracy and simplicity, is required to back up authors’ claim that their method could improve the estimation of age-at-death in forensic cases and aging research (see also Comment for Pages 7-10, References, below). Also, main text and titles on figures need overall English grammar check.

The sentence Analysis of mtDNA damage is based on real-time PCR. However, “the analysis of relative gene expression data was calculated using..." is not very precise, would benefit from re-phrasing. HV2 in D-loop of mitochondrial DNA is not a stricktly coding gene and so it one could use "mtDNA expression" or "folds of amplification" instead.

- P4. Line40 – P5. Line 5:

The authors had developed a new methodology to estimating the age by analyzing mtDNA amplification. However, we would recommend also estimate this age in both population samples using other appropriate approaches to detection of mitochondrial DNA mutations, such as detection of the 4977bp deletion of mtDNA or the age-related point mutation A189G on mtDNA as control approach, to see if the correlation between the mutations of mtDNA and age-at-death is consistent in two approaches. 

- P5. Line7 – Line11:

In the statistical analysis, it is necessary to describe what tests were used to compare difference between the two populations, and what specific tests were used to analyze the correlation and regression.

- P6. Line9:

Main characteristics of the study subjects and folds of HV2 amplification (like sample size, sex, mean/SD, age distribution, etc.) should be presented (e.g., in table) in order to make interpretation of results shown on Figures possible. 

- P6. Line 16:

The claim about “the number of defective amplification events is negatively correlated with the age in dentin from both populations” is not very convincing, because in all the tests, a *p*-value below 0.05 was considered to be significant. But the negative correlation between the number of defective amplification events and age in dentin and pulp was shown the corresponding *p*-value in both populations in Figure 1. 

- P6. Line 37:

The same problem in Figure 2, only correlation coefficients were presented, but their associated *p*-value were not given respectively, the significance was not statistically evaluated.

Many of the reference is not state-of-the-art. Also, additional references have to be included to back up authors’ claim that their approach may improve the estimation of age-at-death in forensic cases and aging research, and therefore it has advantage over existing TCA (tooth-cementum annulations) approach. Wittwer-Backofen U *et al*. (Anthropol Anz. 2014; 71(1-2):65-86), Speller CF *et al*. (J Forensic Sci. 2012 Sep; 57(5):1354-60) also reported the estimation of age-at-death from human bone.

It would improve visual representation if authors also drew regression lines on figures. 

The titles on Figures like “correlation HV2 Amplification vs. AGE” would benefit from re-phrasing, as “vs.” does not seem at place here. E.g., you can try “Correlation between amplification … and age”.  

The image quality of figures could be improved with consistent use of front size on both figures.
